                        <h3>Sun Moon Lake</h3>
                        <p>
                            After breakfast, depart Sun Moon Lake for Alishan by bus. 
                            We will make a stop at a Tea Plantation on the drive to Alishan. 
                            Arrive Alishan at the noontime, and visit the Alishan Forest Recreation.<br>
                            <br> 
                            A leisurely half-day stroll along forested paths allows visitors to take in Alishan’s other attractions. 
                            The enchanting Sisters Ponds are two small pools (one with a wooden bridge and pavilion) named for two lovelorn aborigine sisters. 
                            Another attraction is the Three-Generation Trees – one growing out of another, and a third from the second. Stay overnight at Alishan.

                            Tainan is positioned at the inland of the Wide Chia-Nan Plain and the city was the earliest developed city in Taiwan. 
                            Tainan was an important location for the aboriginals; was then dominated by the Dutch, and later governed by three generations of Cheng Cheng-Kung. 
                            After political construction and changes, Tainan became the first capital of Taiwan.<br>
                            <br> 
                            The city’s rich history and beauty of the ancient capital is still evident today. 
                            Our tour will stop at Anping Port, Chihkan Tower, Eternal Fortress, Koxinga Shrine and Confucius Temple. Overnight at Tainan.
